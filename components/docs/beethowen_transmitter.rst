Beethowen Transmitter
=====================

**Beethowen** is an energy efficient method to transfer data over 
`ESP-NOW <https://www.espressif.com/en/solutions/low-power-solutions/esp-now>`_ Wireless 
Communication Protocol by Espressif Systems between two devices.
*The name came from a playful 2 am brainstorming from "BTHome" + "Over" + "Esp-NoW".*

This component implements local trasmitter and encoding hub.

**ESP-NOW**
  is a wireless communication protocol defined by Espressif, which enables the direct, 
  quick and low-power control of smart devices, without the need of a router. ESP-NOW can work 
  with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE, and supports the ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S and ESP32-C series of SoCs. 
  Itâ€™s widely used in smart-home appliances, remote controlling, sensors, etc.

**BTHome**
  is an energy efficient but flexible format for devices to broadcast their sensor data and button presses 
  originally developed for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices. Devices can run over a year on a single battery.
  It allows data encryption and is supported by popular home automation platforms, 
  like `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io>`__, out of the box.

.. _beethowen-component:

Component/Hub
-------------

The ``beethowen_transmitter`` component creates a global hub so that you can collect beethowen
sensor data from you ESP node and send them to Beethowen receiver remote node.

The beethowen transmitter hub component is an internal model that acts as a central collection
hub to which beethowen transmitter sensors are connected to.

The component depends on the standard WiFi library e.g. ``ESP8266WiFi`` that needs to be added to the 
configuration.
As for now the ``wifi`` component usage is untested and should be avoided.

Auto-find server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``beethowen_transmitter`` automatically checks each channel to find a node with a ``beethowen_receiver`` 
on the vicinity.

Note: some form of authentication or code-matching will be added soon.

.. _config-beethowen:

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (*Optional*, string): Manually specify the ID for this Hub.

- **connect_persistent** (*Optional*, boolean): ESP8266 is able to reconnect to the last used Wi-Fi network or establishes the same Access Point upon power up or reset. By default, these settings are NOT written to specific sectors of flash memory every time they are changed. Frequently calling these functions could cause wear on the flash memory. See `WiFi library <https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.2/esp8266wifi/generic-class.html#persistent>`_ reference.

- **sensors** (*Optional*): Specify sensors to proxy through the beethowen channel. See :ref:`Proxy Sensors <beethowen-sensor_>` for more information.

- **auto_send** (*Optional*, boolean): Regularly check all connected sensors and once all provide a valid state automatically send data.

Automations
***********
- **on_finished_send** (*Optional*, Automation): An automation to perform when a transmission is finished.

.. _bthome-sensor:

Sensor
------

The ``beethowen transmitter sensor`` allows you use a sensor to collect and transfer data to a remote 
Beethowen receiver hub and are listed below the hub.

The beethowen sensor component acts as a proxy sensor that receives data from other pyhsical sensors.

.. code-block:: yaml

  beethowen_transmitter:
    sensors:
      - measurement_type: temperature
        sensor_id: bmp085_temperature_sensor
      - measurement_type: pressure
        sensor_id: bmp085_pressure_sensor

Configuration variables:

- **measurement_type** (*Required*, int **or** string): Measurement type as defined in 
  `BTHome format specification <https://bthome.io/format>`__ either as a string or a numeric value.

- **sensor_id** (*Required*, string): A sensor that is defined in the configuration. Its value will 
  be retrieved and proxied through the beethowen channel.

Sensor Automation
-----------------

on_finished_send
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This automation will be triggered when a transmission is finished though the beethowen channel.
In Lambdas you can get the result and check if there are any outstanding measurements not yet transferred 
with *success*, *has_outstanding_measurements*.


Actions
-------

send
~~~~
This action collects all connected sensor data and sends them thorugh the beethowen channel.

Warning
-------
  
* Supports ESP8266 is completed ESP32 support will be added shortly.
